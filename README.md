# mad-1-household-services
House-hold services is a multi-user app (requires one admin and other service professionals/ customers) which acts as platform for providing comprehensive home servicing and solutions.
The approach for this problem was creating a database and applying the core
functionalities required. It functions similar to apps like urban company. I first created the
login and sign-up pages then create routes in the backend. Later started the main
dashboard for all types of users and updated the backend after that worked on the
search functionality and updated the backend respectively and at last I created the
summary pages and updated the backend whenever needed.

Frameworks and Libraries used:
• Flask :used foe request handling, rendering templates and defining
views/routes for the app.

• Flask SQLAlchemy: defining models , doing query operations on the
database, committing the changes to the database

• SQLite: for database tables

• Matplotlib: for graphs

• HTML and CSS: to create and style the templates/page that is the frontend
technology.

• Jinja: for templating

• Datetime: python library for handling date and time operations
